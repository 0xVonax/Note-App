# Note App

# Project Summary
Many of us have note applications on our phones that will allow us to write down things that we want to remember later, but I wanted to develop a similar application both in order to contribute to my own portfolio and to learn new things in software and improve myself.

# Home
You will be able to see the notes you have taken on the application homepage as a list. When you click on the notes in this list, you can change the title and content of the note from the pop-up window and save it or delete the note if you wish. At the same time, you can click the add note button on the bottom right of the screen, enter the title and content of the note you want to create from the annotation window that opens, save your note and save your note. you can create.
